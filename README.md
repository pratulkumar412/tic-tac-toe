# tic-tac-toe
The Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game

This game is built on Python

Run this command in terminal:
pyhton3 tictac.py

You will be asked to choose a position between 1 to 9.

 1 | 2 | 3
 
 4 | 5 | 6
 
 7 | 8 | 9
 
 X denotes your chosen position.
 
 0 denotes computer's chosen position.
 
 
 The game is designed such that computer plays optimally and there is no chance for the player to win.
 However, you can draw the match if you play optimally ;)
